# Monte Carlo Simulation to Determine Processor Frequency Bins

When using the makefile, your command line should have the following format:\
./Monte_Carlo P C mu sigma S

Where:\
P is the number of processors\
C is the number of critical paths per processor\
mu is the average critical path latency in nanoseconds\
sigma is the standard deviation of critical latency in nanoseconds\
S is the seed used in the random number generator
